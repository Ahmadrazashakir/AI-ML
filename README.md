# AI-ML
--------------------------

Hey there!
Welcome to the roadmap journey.
I am assuming that you have a basic idea of what AI/ML is and what it is capable of.
Although this field is extremely diverse and needs a lot of study and mathematics behind it to understand what's really going on.
--------------------------
There is a roadmap picture in the repo named "ML roadmap.jpg". Go through it and cover all topics. 
Here is a YouTube channel. This is the best available over YouTube to understand the topics in the roadmap.

Cover these topics as well. A lot of them will be mutual to the roadmap though.
